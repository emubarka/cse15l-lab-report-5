# Lab Report 5

- How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

Each tests have different results, and the way I found this out was by searching them manually to check the code that we are testing. 

- Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or your repository, either is fine)
  - For each test:
    - Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
    - Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).

[test-file.md](https://github.com/emubarka/cse15l-lab-report-5/blob/main/test-file.md)
This implementation works out fine, as we have a title and the links working. 

The expected outputs did come out as actual outputs. 

Output: ![Test-file.md](test1.png)  

Code: ![Test-file.md code](test1%20code.png)

[test-file3.md](https://github.com/emubarka/cse15l-lab-report-5/blob/main/test-file3.md)
This implementation doesn't do anything other than provide the title and text of "more text here"

The expected outputs came out similar to the code

Output: ![Test-file3.md](test3.png)

Code: ![Test-file3.md code](test3%20code.png)

---
[test-file5.md](https://github.com/emubarka/cse15l-lab-report-5/blob/main/test-file5.md)
This implentation doesn't do anything other than provide the title and raw output of texts

The expected outputs came similar to the code

Output: ![Test-file5.md](test5.png)

Code: ![Test-file5.md code](test5%20code.png)

---
[test-file6.md](https://github.com/emubarka/cse15l-lab-report-5/blob/main/test-file6.md)
This implementation would work if (page.com) was a link to a photo, but instead it's just a link

The expected output didn't come out as the actual output we wanted

Output: ![Test-file6.md](test6.png)

Code: ![Test-file6.md code](test6%20code.png)

---
[test-file7.md](https://github.com/emubarka/cse15l-lab-report-5/blob/main/test-file7.md)
This implementation only has text that doesn't make anything

The expected output is similar to the code

Output: ![Test-file7.md](test7.png)

Code: ![Test-file7.md code](test7%20codee.png)

---
[test-file8.md](https://github.com/emubarka/cse15l-lab-report-5/blob/main/test-file8.md)
This implementation only has text that doesn't make anything

The expected output is similar to the code

Output: ![Test-file8.md](test8.png)

Code: ![Test-file8.md code](test8%20code.png)
