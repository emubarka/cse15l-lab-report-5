# Lab Report 5

- How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

Each tests have different results, and the way I found this out was by searching them manually to check the code that we are testing. 

- Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or your repository, either is fine)
  - For each test:
    - Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the wrong output
    - Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).

This implementation works out fine, as we have a title and the links working. 

The expected outputs did come out as actual outputs.
